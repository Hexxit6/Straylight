Constructs(mandatory):
    - Unit: nil
    - Number: 1, 1.2, -0.13     -> all numbers are floats for simplicity's sake
    - String: "S0m3th1ng_"      -> difference between a string and an identifier
    - Point: (Number, Number)   -> a single point on a map
    - Blocks:
        city "name" {           -> city is the main block that contains the whole program (similar to main)
            Blocks|Expressions
        }
        road "name" {           -> basic block type used for mapping the city
            Expressions
        }
        building "name" {       -> basic block type used for mapping the city
            Expressions
        }
                                -> all the blocks can hold variables, for loops, other blocks and... well... pretty much everything else
    - Commands:                 -> commands are used inside blocks
        line(Point, Point);
        bend(Point, Point, Angle);
        box(Point, Point);
        circle(Point, Radius);

Constructs(optional):
    - Additional blocks: station, water, park, forest           -> the 'station' block will be a special block containing a color and a radius, others can have a color and are used to focus on allergen types and pollution
    - Color: blue, teal, cyan, green, lime, yellow, pink, white, lightgray, gray, darkgray, black, olive, brown, orange, red, purple, magenta, violet   (predefined LaTeX colors)
    - Color(): color(#color|Color); -> sets current block color
    - Variables: let variable = Expression;
    - Lists: [item1, item2, item3]                              -> useful for the 'for' loop and maybe polyline and polygon commands
    - Flow:
        if (Condition) {
            Expressions
        } elif (Condition) {
            Expressions
        } else {
            Expression
        }
    - Loop:
        for (Variable; Condition; Expression) {
            Expressions (break, continue)
        }
    - Functions:
        func name(arg1, arg2) {
            Expressions
        }
    - Additional commands:
        polyline(Points)                                        -> multiple points specifying a line
        polygon(Points)                                         -> multiple points specifying a polygon or a number specifying a regular polygon


[ BNF is a work-in-progress! ]
-> some blocks are still not implement
-> some things will have to be re-worked e.g. statements,expressions,literals and the 'for' loop (simplified or re-made from scratch)
